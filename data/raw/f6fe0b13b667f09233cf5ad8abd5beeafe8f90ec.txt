Decades ago, some Americans would buy VW cars such as the Rabbit, GTI, and Scirroco because they perceived them as fun, cool, or peppy. What about in 2026?
With all the Volkswagen renaming and new models or potential new models, it gets a bit confusing, and yet one detail stands out. It’s not the small, mythical $25,000 Tesla EV that has been talked about for years, it is a small €25,000 Volkswagen EV. Kyle went to Munich where he learned that, apparently, at least for now, the €25,000 Volkswagen will go into production in 2026. It is also slated to be front-wheel drive, but he prefers rear-wheel drive. The market launch could be one year from now. He says the ID. Polo will not have Rivian software in it.
Here are some more details a person might want to know:
- 2 battery sizes with 3 power outputs
- Motor output 166 kW for the GTI version
- 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in about 7 seconds for the GTI.
- The speculation is that the system architecture will be 400 volts and the battery pack may be about 50 kWh.
- If the cheapest-trim Polo costs €25,000, Kyle thinks maybe only the GTI version might be coming to the US.
He says the charging performance and battery specs are not known yet. The charging port may be in the front on the right side, which Kyle says would work with the Tesla Supercharging network.
In a year, when they are available in Europe, they may do quite well. This is one of the most engaging points because the EV revolution is global, though much attention goes to Tesla because it is based in the US. The most affordable EVs and greatest charging infrastructure may not be in the US.
Volkswagen already leads the EV market in Europe. Will VW be able to take even more market share in Europe with this new, small, affordable electric vehicle?
And will the GTI version, at least, come to the US?

- @Wheatman45: Bring it to the USA, We need more hot hatches please!
- @gameworkerty: i’d actually buy an EV if I could get one of these in the USA.
- @SimplyGregsterEV: VW seems to have finally figured out their next generation EV strategy by focusing on what people actually want. People banter on about Chinese EVs (myself included) but they still don’t quite 100% understand the Western market.
So, if there is an all-electric VW GTI that arrives on US shores fairly soon, would you consider buying one?
