## Top 5 Stories

### 1) Deadly heat linked to big oil: How to tackle net-zero backlash
African leaders at the second Africa climate summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, criticized developed nations for failing to honor climate finance pledges, calling it a "legal obligation" rather than charity. They plan to tap the private sector to fill the gap. The summit repositioned Africa as a global centre for climate solutions, renewable energy, and green growth. A study found that global warming linked to the world's biggest 180 oil and gas companies made all 213 major heatwaves analyzed more intense and frequent, with one-quarter being "virtually impossible" without human-caused global warming. Climate scientists are working to combat net-zero misinformation, which has become a vague term often used to mean "removing CO2" or "saving energy." The scientists aim to clarify the concept's specific definition, which refers to absolute zero emissions.

**Why it matters:** Deadly heat linked to big oil, and African leaders demand climate finance from developed nations.

### 2) Analysis: IPCC's seventh assessment has record-high representation from global south
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is preparing its seventh assessment cycle, with over 660 scientists from 90 countries selected to write the three working group reports. These reports, scheduled for publication by 2029, will summarize the latest research on climate change. Analysis by Carbon Brief finds that a record 42% of authors are based at institutions in the global south, marking the highest representation from these countries in any IPCC assessment reports. The working groups will have an equal 50-50 representation of authors who are citizens of the global north and global south. The IPCC's seventh assessment cycle will feature three working group reports: the physical science basis, impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, and mitigation of climate change. This increased representation from the global south reflects a shift towards greater diversity and inclusivity in the IPCC's authorship.

**Why it matters:** The IPCC's seventh assessment has a record-high representation from global south institutions, with 42% of authors affiliated with institutions in these countries.

### 3) Labor's 2035 emissions target a 'sliding doors' moment for future generations
The Albanese government's 2035 emissions target is under scrutiny as Australia's climate department forecast indicates a 51% reduction in emissions by 2035, falling short of the required pace to meet the new target. The government's decision is seen as a "sliding doors moment" for the country, with the international goal to keep global heating to 1.5C now hanging by a thread. Climate advocates warn that a weak target will be a betrayal of people and the planet, while critics argue that Labor has "given up on the science." The prime minister is expected to announce a target range after a cabinet meeting, with leading climate advocates urging a target aligned with the 1.5C goal. The decision is seen as critical in convincing the rest of the world to follow Australia's lead on climate action.

**Why it matters:** Australia's 2035 emissions target may determine the country's ability to meet the 1.5C global heating goal.

### 4) Climate risk assessment finds Australia is on a 'knife-edge' to meet 1.5C goal
Australia is on track to reduce emissions by 51% on 2005 levels by 2035, but the Albanese government must accelerate efforts to meet the new target. The national climate risk assessment found no Australian would escape the threats of the climate crisis, with 1.5 million people at risk from rising sea levels and heat-related deaths surging if global heating rose above 2C. The assessment described as a "wake-up call" by Albanese, warned of the country's economic future if global emissions are not curbed and temperatures continue to rise. Climate advocates have warned the government's decision on a 2035 emissions reduction will be a historic "sliding doors moment" for the country, with the international goal to keep global heating to 1.5C now hanging by a thread. The prime minister is expected to announce a target range on Thursday, with leading climate advocates stressing the need for the target to be aligned with keeping global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.

**Why it matters:** Australia is on track to miss its 1.5C global heating goal and 1.5 million people could be at risk from climate-related threats.

### 5) New study links global warming to all major heatwaves since 2000
A new study has linked global warming to all major heatwaves since 2000. The research used "extreme event attribution" to assess the impact of climate change on 213 heatwaves classified as "major disasters" between 2000 and 2023. The study found that global warming, primarily caused by the world's largest 180 oil and gas companies, made all 213 heatwaves more intense and frequent. It also discovered that one-quarter of the heatwaves would have been "virtually impossible" without human-caused global warming. The study's findings highlight the significant role of fossil fuel companies in exacerbating heatwaves, which are becoming increasingly deadly due to climate change. The research emphasizes the urgent need to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of extreme heat events.

**Why it matters:** Global warming is linked to all major heatwaves since 2000.
