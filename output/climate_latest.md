### 2) Analysis: IPCC’s seventh assessment has record-high representation from global south
Summary:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) seventh assessment cycle (AR7) will feature a record-high representation from global south institutions, with 42% of authors based at institutions in the global south. The three working group reports, scheduled to be published by 2029, will have an equal 50-50 representation of authors who are citizens of the global north and global south. The AR7 working groups will comprise over 660 scientists from 90 countries.

Why it matters: This increased representation from the global south is crucial for ensuring that the IPCC's climate change assessments accurately reflect the diverse perspectives and experiences of countries most vulnerable to climate change.

Key points:
* The IPCC's seventh assessment cycle (AR7) will feature a record 42% of authors based at institutions in the global south.
* The AR7 working groups will have an equal 50-50 representation of authors who are citizens of the global north and global south.
