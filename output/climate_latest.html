<h3>1) Debriefed 12 September 2025: Africa calls for promised finance; Deadly heat linked to big oil; How to tackle net-zero backlash</h3>
<p>Summary:
African leaders at the second Africa climate summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, criticized developed nations for failing to honor climate finance pledges. They emphasized that providing climate finance is a legal obligation, not charity, as stated in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. The declaration also welcomed the use of carbon markets in Africa, which has led to controversy.</p>
<p>Why it matters: The African leaders' stance on climate finance and carbon markets sets a decisive moment for the continent heading into COP30.</p>
<p>Key points:
- African leaders chastised developed nations for failing to honor climate finance pledges.
- Providing climate finance is considered a legal obligation, not charity, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.
- The declaration welcomed the use of carbon markets in Africa, which has led to controversy.</p>

<h3>2) Analysis: IPCC’s seventh assessment has record-high representation from global south</h3>
<p>Summary:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) seventh assessment cycle (AR7) will feature a record-high representation from global south institutions, with 42% of authors based at institutions in the global south. The three working group reports, scheduled to be published by 2029, will have an equal 50-50 representation of authors who are citizens of the global north and global south. The AR7 working groups will comprise over 660 scientists from 90 countries.</p>
<p>Why it matters: This increased representation from the global south is crucial for ensuring that the IPCC's climate change assessments accurately reflect the diverse perspectives and experiences of countries most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<p>Key points:
* The IPCC's seventh assessment cycle (AR7) will feature a record 42% of authors based at institutions in the global south.
* The AR7 working groups will have an equal 50-50 representation of authors who are citizens of the global north and global south.
* The three working group reports, scheduled to be published by 2029, will comprise over 660 scientists from 90 countries.</p>
